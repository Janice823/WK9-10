  <h3> Reflection on libraries support for student research in the internet age.</h3>
  <p> In the age of the internet, many may assume that libraries are a thing of the past. However, I believe that this is not necessarily true, especially for college students. It very easily could have gone this way however. Libraries in their most basic form are places that we store our information. It used to be that books were the only way to get this information, and libraries were where you got the books. With the internet however, anyone with a computer can access almost limitless information without leaving their own homes. Libraries have adapted to include the internet as a source of information now and offer enough services of their own to make it worth students to leave their dorms. </p>
  <p> Here at CCSU, the library is more than a building of books. The CCSU library offers many computers for those that may not have access otherwise, giving them the researching power of the internet. The CCSU library is also very web integrated. You can now search through the whole libraryâ€™s catalogs with a simple search query, making it easier than ever to find the book you need. CCSU also offers many online texts free of charge to students, giving students access to more journals and other resources. </p>
